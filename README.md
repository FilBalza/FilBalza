# 👋 Hi, I’m **Filippo Balzaretti**

Mathematician, physicist, and computational chemist in love with **ab initio modeling**, **surface science**, and **catalysis**.  
I work on **quantum-chemistry method development**, bridging **DFT**, **DFTB**, **force fields**, and **ML interatomic potentials**.  
I recently started my open-source journey and I take it seriously, building tools, sharing workflows, and keeping science transparent.

## 🔬 What I’m working on
- Mixing **neural networks** with **high-accuracy TB frameworks** to bypass the U-dependent limitations of traditional DFT PBE  
- Developing and testing **MLIPs**, making extensive use of MACE, UMA, CHGNet, M3GNet, for materials modeling  
- Building reliable workflows for **electronic-structure analysis**, **d-band descriptors**, and **high-throughput screenings**
